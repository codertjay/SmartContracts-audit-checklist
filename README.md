> A checklist of things to look for when auditing Solidity smart contracts.

This is not a comprehensive list and solidity is quickly evolving so please do due dilegence on your part.

Not all listed items will apply to your specific smart contract.

## Audit Scoping 
Before starting the audits you need to know about the projects codebase. You can easily do this task using [Consensys](https://diligence.consensys.net)'s [Solidity-Code-Metrics](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-metrics). 

Here the details, How you can easy understand the projets scop.

[üåê](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-code-metrics) `npm install solidity-code-metrics` 

The number-crunching enginge behind üìä[tintinweb.solidity-metrics](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintinweb.solidity-metrics).

## General Review Approach:


- [ ] All functions are `internal` except where explictly required to be `public`/`external`. [[?](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7)]
- [ ] There are no arithmetic overflows/underflows in math operations.
- [ ] Using the OpenZeppelin safe math library [[?](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/math)].
- [ ] Ether or tokens cannot be accidentally sent to the address `0x0`.
- [ ] Conditions are checked using `require` before operations and state changes.
- [ ] State is being set before and performing actions.
- [ ] Protected from reentry attacks (A calling B calling A). [[?](https://medium.com/@gus_tavo_guim/reentrancy-attack-on-smart-contracts-how-to-identify-the-exploitable-and-an-example-of-an-attack-4470a2d8dfe4)]
- [ ] Properly implements the ERC20 interface [[?](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/20)].
- [ ] Only using modifier if necessary in more than one place.
- [ ] All types are being explicitly set (e.g. using `uint256` instead of `uint`).
- [ ] All methods and loops are within the maximum allowed gas limt.
- [ ] There are no unnecessary initalizations in the constructor (remember, default values are set).
- [ ] There is complete test coverage; every smart contract method and every possible type of input is being tested.
- [ ] Performed fuzz testing by using random inputs.
- [ ] Tested all the possible different states that the contract can be in.
- [ ] Ether and token amounts are dealt in wei units.
- [ ] The crowdsale end block/timestamp comes after start block/timestamp.
- [ ] The crowdsale token exchange/conversion rate is properly set.
- [ ] The crowdsale soft/hard cap is set.
- [ ] The crowdsale min/max contribution allowed is set and tested.
- [ ] The crowdsale whitelisting functionality is tested.
- [ ] The crowdsale refund logic is tested.
- [ ] Crowdsale participants are given their proportional token amounts or are allowed to claim their contribution.
- [ ] The length of each stage of the crowdsale is properly configured (e.g. presale, public sale).
- [ ] Specified which functions are intented to be controlled by the owner only (e.g. pausing crowdsale, progressing crowdsale stage, enabling distribution of tokens, etc..).
- [ ] The crowdsale vesting logic is tested.
- [ ] The crowdsale has a fail-safe mode that when enabled by owner, restricts calls to function and enables refund functionality.
- [ ] The crowdsale has a fallback function in place if it makes reasonable sense.
- [ ] The fallback function does not accept call data or only accepts prefixed data to avoid function signature collisions.
- [ ] Imported libraries have been previously audited and don't contain dyanmic parts that can be swapped out in future versions which can be be used maliciously. [[?](http://swende.se/blog/Devcon1-and-contract-security.html)]
- [ ] Token transfer statements are wrapped in a `require`.
- [ ] Using `require` and `assert` properly. Only use `assert` for things that should never happen, typically used to validate state after making changes.
- [ ] Using `keccak256` instead of the alias `sha3`.
- [ ] Protected from ERC20 short address attack. [[?](https://vessenes.com/the-erc20-short-address-attack-explained/)].
- [ ] Protected from recursive call attacks.
- [ ] Arbitrary string inputs have length limits.
- [ ] No secret data is exposed (all data on the blockchain is public).
- [ ] Avoided using array where possible and using mappings instead.
- [ ] Does not rely on block hashes for randomness (miners have influence on this).
- [ ] Does not use `tx.origin` anywhere. [[?](https://vessenes.com/tx-origin-and-ethereum-oh-my/)]
- [ ] Array items are shifted down when an item is deleted to avoid leaving a gap.
- [ ] Use `revert` instead of `throw`.
- [ ] Functions exit immediately when conditions aren't meant.
- [ ] Using the latest stable version of Solidity.
- [ ] Prefer pattern where receipient withdrawals funds instead of contract sending funds, however not always applicable.
- [ ] Resolved warnings from compiler.


## Variables

- [ ] `V1` - Can it be `internal`?
- [ ] `V2` - Can it be `constant`?
- [ ] `V3` - Can it be `immutable`?
- [ ] `V4` - Is its visibility set? (SWC-108)
- [ ] `V5` - Is the purpose of the variable and other important information documented using natspec?
- [ ] `V6` - Can it be packed with an adjacent storage variable?
- [ ] [ ] `V7` - Can it be packed in a struct with more than 1 other variable?
- [ ] `V8` - Use full 256 bit types unless packing with other variables.
- [ ] `V9` - If it's a public array, is a separate function provided to return the full array?
- [ ] `V10` - Only use `private` to intentionally prevent child contracts from accessing the variable, prefer `internal` for flexibility.

## Structs

- [ ] `S1` - Is a struct necessary? Can the variable be packed raw in storage?
- [ ] `S2` - Are its fields packed together (if possible)?
- [ ] `S3` - Is the purpose of the struct and all fields documented using natspec?

## Functions

- [ ] `F1` - Can it be `external`?
- [ ] `F2` - Should it be `internal`?
- [ ] `F3` - Should it be `payable`?
- [ ] `F4` - Can it be combined with another similar function?
- [ ] `F5` - Validate all parameters are within safe bounds, even if the function can only be called by a trusted users.
- [ ] `F6` - Is the checks before effects pattern followed? (SWC-107)
- [ ]- `F7` - Check for front-running possibilities, such as the approve function. (SWC-114)
- [ ] `F8` - Is insufficient gas griefing possible? (SWC-126)
- [ ] `F9` - Are the correct modifiers applied, such as `onlyOwner`/`requiresAuth`?
- [ ] `F10` - Are return values always assigned?
- [ ] `F11` - Write down and test invariants about state before a function can run correctly.
- [ ] `F12` - Write down and test invariants about the return or any changes to state after a function has run.
- [ ] `F13` - Take care when naming functions, because people will assume behavior based on the name.
- [ ] `F14` - If a function is intentionally unsafe (to save gas, etc), use an unwieldy name to draw attention to its risk.
- [ ] `F15` - Are all arguments, return values, side effects and other information documented using natspec?
- [ ] `F16` - If the function allows operating on another user in the system, do not assume `msg.sender` is the user being operated on.
- [ ] `F17` - If the function requires the contract be in an uninitialized state, check an explicit `initialized` variable. Do not use `owner == address(0)` or other similar checks as substitutes.
- [ ] `F18` - Only use `private` to intentionally prevent child contracts from calling the function, prefer `internal` for flexibility.
- [ ] `F19` - Use `virtual` if there are legitimate (and safe) instances where a child contract may wish to override the function's behavior.

## Modifiers

- [ ] `M1` - Are no storage updates made (except in a reentrancy lock)?
- [ ] `M2` - Are external calls avoided?
- [ ] `M3` - Is the purpose of the modifier and other important information documented using natspec?

## Code

- [ ] `C1` - Using SafeMath or 0.8 checked math? (SWC-101)
- [ ] `C2` - Are any storage slots read multiple times?
- [ ] `C3` - Are any unbounded loops/arrays used that can cause DoS? (SWC-128)
- [ ] `C4` - Use `block.timestamp` only for long intervals. (SWC-116)
- [ ] `C5` - Don't use block.number for elapsed time. (SWC-116)
- [ ] `C7` - Avoid delegatecall wherever possible, especially to external (even if trusted) contracts. (SWC-112)
- [ ] `C8` - Do not update the length of an array while iterating over it.
- [ ] `C9` - Don't use `blockhash()`, etc for randomness. (SWC-120)
- [ ] `C10` - Are signatures protected against replay with a nonce and `block.chainid` (SWC-121)
- [ ] `C11` - Ensure all signatures use EIP-712. (SWC-117 SWC-122)
- [ ] `C12` - Output of `abi.encodePacked()` shouldn't be hashed if using >2 dynamic types. Prefer using `abi.encode()` in general. (SWC-133)
- [ ] `C13` - Careful with assembly, don't use any arbitrary data. (SWC-127)
- [ ] `C14` - Don't assume a specific ETH balance. (SWC-132)
- [ ] `C15` - Avoid insufficient gas griefing. (SWC-126)
- [ ] `C16` - Private data isn't private. (SWC-136)
- [ ] `C17` - Updating a struct/array in memory won't modify it in storage.
- [ ] `C18` - Never shadow state variables. (SWC-119)
- [ ] `C19` - Do not mutate function parameters.
- [ ] `C20` - Is calculating a value on the fly cheaper than storing it?
- [ ] `C21` - Are all state variables read from the correct contract (master vs. clone)?
- [ ] `C22` - Are comparison operators used correctly (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), especially to prevent off-by-one errors?
- [ ] `C23` - Are logical operators used correctly (`==`, `!=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`), especially to prevent off-by-one errors?
- [ ] `C24` - Always multiply before dividing, unless the multiplication could overflow.
- [ ] `C25` - Are magic numbers replaced by a constant with an intuitive name?
- [ ] `C26` - If the recipient of ETH had a fallback function that reverted, could it cause DoS? (SWC-113)
- [ ] `C27` - Use SafeERC20 or check return values safely.
- [ ] `C28` - Don't use `msg.value` in a loop.
- [ ] `C29` - Don't use `msg.value` if recursive delegatecalls are possible (like if the contract inherits `Multicall`/`Batchable`).
- [ ] `C30` - Don't assume `msg.sender` is always a relevant user.
- [ ] `C31` - Don't use `assert()` unless for fuzzing or formal verification. (SWC-110)
- [ ] `C32` - Don't use `tx.origin` for authorization. (SWC-115)
- [ ] `C33` - Don't use `address.transfer()` or `address.send()`. Use `.call.value(...)("")` instead. (SWC-134)
- [ ] `C34` - When using low-level calls, ensure the contract exists before calling.
- [ ] `C35` - When calling a function with many parameters, use the named argument syntax.
- [ ] `C36` - Do not use assembly for create2. Prefer the modern salted contract creation syntax.
- [ ] `C37` - Do not use assembly to access chainid or contract code/size/hash. Prefer the modern Solidity syntax.
- [ ] `C38` - Use the `delete` keyword when setting a variable to a zero value (`0`, `false`, `""`, etc).
- [ ] `C39` - Comment the "why" as much as possible.
- [ ] `C40` - Comment the "what" if using obscure syntax or writing unconventional code.
- [ ] `C41` - Comment explanations + example inputs/outputs next to complex and fixed point math.
- [ ] `C42` - Comment explanations wherever optimizations are done, along with an estimate of much gas they save.
- [ ] `C43` - Comment explanations wherever certain optimizations are purposely avoided, along with an estimate of much gas they would/wouldn't save if implemented.
- [ ] `C44` - Use `unchecked` blocks where overflow/underflow is impossible, or where an overflow/underflow is unrealistic on human timescales (counters, etc). Comment explanations wherever `unchecked` is used, along with an estimate of how much gas it saves (if relevant).
- [ ] `C45` - Do not depend on Solidity's arithmetic operator precedence rules. In addition to the use of parentheses to override default operator precedence, parentheses should also be used to emphasise it.
- [ ] `C46` - Expressions passed to logical/comparison operators (`&&`/`||`/`>=`/`==`/etc) should not have side-effects.
- [ ] `C47` - Wherever arithmetic operations are performed that could result in precision loss, ensure it benefits the right actors in the system, and document it with comments.
- [ ] `C48` - Document the reason why a reentrancy lock is necessary whenever it's used with an inline or `@dev` natspec comment.
- [ ] `C49` - When fuzzing functions that only operate on specific numerical ranges use modulo to tighten the fuzzer's inputs (such as `x = x % 10000 + 1` to restrict from 1 to 10,000).
- [ ] `C50` - Use ternary expressions to simplify branching logic wherever possible.
- [ ] `C51` - When operating on more than one address, ask yourself what happens if they're the same.

## External Calls

- [ ] `X1` - Is an external contract call actually needed?
- [ ] `X2` - If there is an error, could it cause DoS? Like `balanceOf()` reverting. (SWC-113)
- [ ] `X3` - Would it be harmful if the call reentered into the current function?
- [ ] `X4` - Would it be harmful if the call reentered into another function?
- [ ] `X5` - Is the result checked and errors dealt with? (SWC-104)
- [ ] `X6` - What if it uses all the gas provided?
- [ ] `X7` - Could it cause an out-of-gas in the calling contract if it returns a massive amount of data?
- [ ] `X8` - If you are calling a particular function, do not assume that `success` implies that the function exists (phantom functions).

## Static Calls

- [ ] `S1` - Is an external contract call actually needed?
- [ ] `S2` - Is it actually marked as view in the interface?
- [ ] `S3` - If there is an error, could it cause DoS? Like `balanceOf()` reverting. (SWC-113)
- [ ] `S4` - If the call entered an infinite loop, could it cause DoS?

## Events

- [ ] `E1` - Should any fields be indexed?
- [ ] `E2` - Is the creator of the relevant action included as an indexed field?
- [ ] `E3` - Do not index dynamic types like strings or bytes.
- [ ] `E4` - Is when the event emitted and all fields documented using natspec?
- [ ] `E5` - Are all users/ids that are operated on in functions that emit the event stored as indexed fields?

## Contract

- [ ] `T1` - Use an SPDX license identifier.
- [ ] `T2` - Are events emitted for every storage mutating function?
- [ ] `T3` - Check for correct inheritance, keep it simple and linear. (SWC-125)
- [ ] `T4` - Use a `receive() external payable` function if the contract should accept transferred ETH.
- [ ] `T5` - Write down and test invariants about relationships between stored state.
- [ ] `T6` - Is the purpose of the contract and how it interacts with others documented using natspec?
- [ ] `T7` - The contract should be marked `abstract` if another contract must inherit it to unlock its full functionality.
- [ ] `T8` - Emit an appropriate event for any non-immutable variable set in the constructor that emits an event when mutated elsewhere.
- [ ] `T9` - Avoid over-inheritance as it masks complexity and encourages over-abstraction.
- [ ] `T10` - Always use the named import syntax to explicitly declare which contracts are being imported from another file.
- [ ] `T11` - Group imports by their folder/package. Separate groups with an empty line. Groups of external dependencies should come first, then mock/testing contracts (if relevant), and finally local imports.
- [ ] `T12` - Summarize the purpose and functionality of the contract with a `@notice` natspec comment. Document how the contract interacts with other contracts inside/outside the project in a `@dev` natspec comment.

## Project

- [ ] `P1` - Use the right license (you must use GPL if you depend on GPL code, etc).
- [ ] `P2` - Unit test everything.
- [ ] `P3` - Fuzz test as much as possible.
- [ ] `P4` - Use symbolic execution where possible.
- [ ] `P5` - Run Slither/Solhint and review all findings.

## DeFi

- [ ] `D1` - Check your assumptions about what other contracts do and return.
- [ ] `D2` - Don't mix internal accounting with actual balances.
- [ ] `D3` - Don't use spot price from an AMM as an oracle.
- [ ] `D4` - Do not trade on AMMs without receiving a price target off-chain or via an oracle.
- [ ] `D5` - Use sanity checks to prevent oracle/price manipulation.
- [ ] `D6` - Watch out for rebasing tokens. If they are unsupported, ensure that property is documented.
- [ ] `D7` - Watch out for ERC-777 tokens. Even a token you trust could preform reentrancy if it's an ERC-777.
- [ ] `D8` - Watch out for fee-on-transfer tokens. If they are unsupported, ensure that property is documented.
- [ ] `D9` - Watch out for tokens that use too many or too few decimals. Ensure the max and min supported values are documented.
- [ ] `D10` - Be careful of relying on the raw token balance of a contract to determine earnings. Contracts which provide a way to recover assets sent directly to them can mess up share price functions that rely on the raw Ether or token balances of an address.
- [ ] `D11` - If your contract is a target for token approvals, do not make arbitrary calls from user input.
